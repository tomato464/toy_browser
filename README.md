In this repository, I want to make http server/client app. Thorough this project, we can understand the concept of how browser are working.

our goal:
(one terminal)./server
(another teminal)./client(browser)
then come up with

	[--Hello world--

	sample html sentence

	]

I plan to make it from scratch as possible as I can, from linux syscall.
